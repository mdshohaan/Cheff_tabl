        We can say that a chef is an all-in-all person who manages restaurant
        matters diligently. From deciding the menu of the restaurant to buying
        the food supplies and managing the food preparation, a chef ensures that
        visitors and guests receive the best cuisines. Apart from this, they
        also supervise other staff in the kitchen and allocate responsibilities
        equally.
